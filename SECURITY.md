# Security Guide - MedAssist AI Mobile App

## üîê API Key Security

### Safe Practices ‚úÖ

**Client-Side Storage**
- API keys are stored only in your browser's local storage
- Keys never leave your device or get sent to our servers
- Direct communication with Google's Gemini API only

**Secure Setup**
- Always use your own personal API key
- Never share your API key with others
- Generate keys with minimal required permissions

**Regular Security**
- Regenerate API keys periodically
- Remove unused API keys from Google AI Studio
- Keep your browser updated for security patches

### What to Avoid ‚ùå

**Never Do This:**
- Don't share API keys in screenshots or recordings
- Don't commit API keys to version control
- Don't use API keys from unknown sources
- Don't store API keys in unsecured locations

**Production Warnings:**
- This is a demo app - for production medical apps, use server-side API management
- Consider additional authentication layers for sensitive medical environments
- Implement proper audit logging for medical compliance

## üè• Medical Data Privacy

### Data Handling

**Local First**
- Chat conversations stored only on your device
- No conversation data sent to our servers
- Clear browser data to remove chat history

**Google's Privacy**
- Conversations are subject to Google's privacy policy
- Google may use conversations to improve their models
- Review Google's terms for medical data usage

**Best Practices**
- Don't include personal identifying information in questions
- Use general medical questions rather than specific patient details
- Consider this educational information only

### Privacy Controls

**User Controls**
- Clear chat history anytime through browser settings
- Disable/enable local storage through browser preferences
- Uninstall app to remove all local data

**Recommendations**
- Use private/incognito browsing for sensitive questions
- Consider dedicated device for medical applications
- Regular privacy audits of stored data
